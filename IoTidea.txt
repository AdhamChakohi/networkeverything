My idea for an IoT device is an IoT connected cigarette box to help people quit smoking. It can detect when cigarettes are placed in it and keeps track of the number of cigarettes there. It studies your smoking habits, and notifies you when it is time for you to have a cigarette, and over time decreases the number of cigarettes you are consuming until you quit entirely. For example: on Monday you're only allowed to have 3 cigarettes, so it calculates the best time for you to have those cigarettes to space them out as much as possible so you're not starting the withdrawal process at the end of the day.
