Linked chapters 1-3 reaction:

first, I would like to mention a few small things I would disagree with in the book. To begin with the book mentions that Paul Erd≈ës was the "presiding genius and most famous misfit of the 20th century." This statement is very debatable as in my opinion Richard Feynman was that. Aditionally, the book mentioned that we basically know all the fundamental building blocks of the world, but we don't know how to put it back together. However, as far as my understanding goes, we now know through Quantum physics that the universe is indeed fundamentally random and made up entirely of probabilities. 
I was intirgued by the cocktail party analogy, and drew a parallel between that and NYUAD. Everyone arrives in NYUAD not knowing anyone else, and then build connections. In such a small campus, there is no doubt that there is an average of at least one link per person, forming a cluster spanning the entire university. This allows gossip and rumors to spread like wildfire, which results in a large number of people knowing a large number of things about a lot of other people. This does not hold true for larger campuses like NYU, because not eveyone tells everything they know to everyone they know.
