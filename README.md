Linked chapters 1-3 reaction:

first, I would like to mention a few small things I would disagree with in the book. To begin with the book mentions that Paul Erd≈ës was the "presiding genius and most famous misfit of the 20th century." This statement is very debatable as in my opinion Richard Feynman was that. Aditionally, the book mentioned that we basically know all the fundamental building blocks of the world, but we don't know how to put it back together. However, as far as my understanding goes, we now know through Quantum physics that the universe is indeed fundamentally random and made up entirely of probabilities. 

I was intirgued by the cocktail party analogy, and drew a parallel between that and NYUAD. Everyone arrives in NYUAD not knowing anyone else, and then build connections. In such a small campus, there is no doubt that there is an average of at least one link per person, forming a cluster spanning the entire university. This allows gossip and rumors to spread like wildfire, which results in a large number of people knowing a large number of things about a lot of other people. This does not hold true for larger campuses like NYU, because not eveyone tells everything they know to everyone they know. 

Internet of Things:

Example of an Internet of things device I find useful: [The Google Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cpUwbr5YyE)

The google home is a product for a very niche market, however I think it is very useful for that niche. If you are already into the google environment, use google calendar, google keep, google maps, google assistant, and the likes, this product may appeal to you. It is one of the products of the new generation of speakers dubbed "smart speakers", but it is more than that. Google has gotten very good at indexing answers to questions from the internet, and anything that google can index, the google home can answer. Aditionally, it connects to your android phone and can do functions on there like play from your phone's spotify. But it is even more than a smart speaker, if you have a 'smart home' set up, it can connect to that and control things like your thermostat and lighting. 

Example of an internet of things device I find useless: [HiderateMe, the smart water bottle](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/582920317/hidrateme-smart-water-bottle) 

if you start watching the video on this 'smart water bottle' kickstarter page (which got 20 times the funding it needed btw), the video begins with this woman who is complaining about being tired after working out all the time, and then she realized that the reason she is tired is because she is not drinking water. I am not joking, go and watch it. She forgot to drink water. I don't know if the creaters of this smart water bottle realize, but usually humans have a pretty good indicator of needing water. Someone needs to tell them, and their backers on kickstarter.
